# Requesting Content

You can request new Movies or TV Shows in two ways:

1. Visit [{{ vars.request_url }}](https://{{ vars.request_url }}) to make direct for movies or TV shows. These are typically approved within 10-15 minutes, and if the content has been released digitally, it will be ready to stream on Plex within 10 minutes.
2. Log in with your Plex account credentials.

   
3. Use the "Search Movies & TV" bar at the top of the page if you know what you are looking for. Otherwise, you can scroll through and browse the content to your heart's content. 
5. Add content to your Plex Universal Watchlist, and it will be appear in your Overseerr library.

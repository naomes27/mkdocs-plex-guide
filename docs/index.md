This guide details common tasks you'll need to perform when joining my Plex server for the first time. The content herein should answer 99% of your questions, though you're always welcome to ask me directly. While this guide primarily shows screenshots from a web browser, you can make these changes from any Plex app (mobile, smart TV, or game console). If you have trouble finding a particular setting, I recommend switching to a web browser to make the changes. All settings in this guide will sync across your devices and only need to be configured once, with one important exception: Plex streaming quality must be set separately the first time you log into each new Plex application.
<br><br>
While you don't need to read this guide from start to finish, new Plex users should at least review the essential sections on [Pinning Libraries](pinning-libraries.md) and [Changing Plex streaming quality](changing-stream-quality/index.md).

!!! note Essential links: <br>Plex: https://app.plex.tv/desktop (on your computer), or through the Mobile or Device applications (Android, iPhone/iPad, AppleTV, Roku, etc.)<br>Overseerr: [{{ vars.request_url }}](https://{{ vars.request_url }}) (only needed if you are requesting content, Plex account on my server is required).
